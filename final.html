			<h4> <b> Four Years After Covid-19 Lockdown, Experts Reflect on Four Factors Causing Vaccination Disparities in Wisconsin</b> </h4>
			<h3> A data story for JNL 221, a data journalism course <br>By David Jacobs </h3>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>A Brief History of Vaccinations</h3> 
			<p>In 1998, then-physician Andrew Wakefield and colleagues published an internationally consequential hypothesis in the well-reknowned journal <i> Lancet. </i> Wakefield fraudently claimed the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine caused autism in children, which would later be proven unequivocally false. It was determined Wakefield had come upon his conclusions unethically and oversimplistically, not following the rules of science to test for other variables outside of the vaccine. 
			But, the claim's refute wasn't made until years later. The damage was already done. According to Medical Director of State of Iowa Medicaid, Dr. William Jagiello, the false claims linking autism to vaccines were irreparably imprinted on a hefty portion of the American population. </p> 
			<p> 
			"That rebirthed the culture of conspiracism here, and now often, people don't know what to believe about the vaccines," Jagiello said. </p>
			
			<p> Disinformation, false information intended to mislead, reached a new pandemic high when the Pfizer-BioNTech Coronavirus vaccine was  released, as conspiracists doubted the abnormally quick medical acceptance process. Some, now over four years later, still claim the government created the pandemic and the vaccine was its way to track people. Some think the virus was made in a Chinese lab, which former President Donald Trump helped theorize. Those are just a couple culturally viral yet wholistically misconceived beliefs about the pandemic. 
			
			<p> However, they are nowhere near the only misunderstandings. 50 months removed from the largest-ever American lockdown, questions abound for some regarding the Pfizer vaccine and the many other available, government-tested-and-recommended options. Why in Wisconsin, a historic "swing state" in political elections, should we expect anything different than a partisan divide on a national topic? There are many reasons the Dairy State is still nowhere near fully vaccinated, but with the guide of several experts, I've compiled the four most compelling reasons Wisconsin has a stark disparity in several categories of fully vaccinated populations. </p>

			<h3>1. American Leadership Hesitated </h3>
			<img class="fade-img" src="Figure1.webp" alt="Covid-19 Vaccines Are Still Debated Heavily in American Politics" height="200px" width="250px">
			<p> The largest reason the pandemic wiped across America, according to Suzanne Gehl, the medical director of Horizon Inpatient Hospice, was because the United States government didn't establish community policies effectively. Having been in family medicine at the time the coronavirus spread, she saw firsthand how different communities in Wisconsin were told different safety guidelines depending where they lived. </p>
			<p> "It was a whole lot of research I had to do just to give my patients their safety plans while I was helping out with telehealth," Gehl said. "Really it was just too much to keep track of, and the whole time it made me think about the kids involved and how confused they must have been." </p>
			
			<p> "The stumbles and the mind-changing by the American government" [were one of the main propagators of Covid-19's spread], Jagiello said. "From Iowa, I bet my policies were different than yours [in Wisconsin]." </p>
			<p> Jagiello says inconsistency with mask and vaccine policies were "no small stumble[s] because [they] caused a loss of faith in the government and government agencies." </p>

			Jagiello said it was "on Biden and the other health administrators" to make expectations regarding masking, social distancing, and eventually vaccinations, and that the CDC was "remarkably" inconsistent.

			<h3>2. A Contentious Political Divide </h3>
			<img class="fade-img" src="Figure2.wbpg.png" alt="Within Region 5 of the Health and Human Services, Wisconsin is the most Republican, on average." height="200px" width="250px">
			<p> A recent Syracuse University professor conducted a survey of 3,000 Americans from various areas in 2021, the first full year of Covid-19 vaccinations being accessible, to investigate general health behaviors of both Republicans and Democrats. Shana Kushner Gadarian, a professor at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, observed there were notable lifestyle differences on the two sides of the partisan scale. She was quoted by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-arent-new-to-the-anti-vaxx-movement/" target="_blank">fivethirtyeight.com</a> claiming political party, regardless of age and several other factors, was the strongest indicator of how many Coronavirus cases there were in a given area at a time. Before vaccinations were released to the public, Pew conducted a study and found nearly double the percent of Democrats (85%) found Covid-19 to be a major threat to United States health than did Republicans (46%). Overall, Republicans tended to be more adventurous in the pre-vaccine Covid-19 era than did Democrats, also leading to fewer total vaccinations for Republicans.

			<p>This was true within the midwest as well. Indiana, for example, is a heavily Republican state, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/database/compare/party-affiliation/by/state/" target="_blank">the Pew Research Center.</a> 
			The Hoosier State unsurprisingly has the lowest first-dose vaccination rate of any of the six states in the Great Lakes midwest of the Health and Human Services map. Wisconsin, though, has the highest despite being the third-most Republican of the six.</p>
			
			<p> Undebatably, relative to other states with middling political tendencies based on Pew's research, Wisconsin has one of the highest fully-vaccinated rates in the nation. The Cheese State is split right down the middle politically with 42% of the adult population identifying as Republican, 16% as Independent and an equivalent 42% as Democratic. Yet, <a href="https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/" target="_blank">per usafacts.org,</a> among the 12 states in which red and blue are within 2% population of one another, Wisconsin has 67% fully vaccinated, second just to Colorado (72%).

				<h3>3. Some Counties Have Higher Population Density than Others</h3>
				<p> "Rural populations typically trend Republican in the midwest," Jagiello said, which Gehl echoed. </p>
				<p> Within Wisconsin, it makes sense there would be a greater number of Republican-leaning counties. Republicans tend to live more rurally in the midwest, according to Gehl, but there are more urban areas like Milwaukee and Dane County that tend to be Democratic, usually associated with high vaccination rates. Dane County in particular is a standout; not only does it have the highest fully vaccinated rate of any of the 72 counties in Wisconsin, it also has the fewest deaths per 100,000 residents, according to the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention. The difference between rural/urban and Republican/Democrat can be a bit hazy sometimes, but Milwaukee County is a perfect example of why the two are their own categories.</p>
				<p> Milwaukee County boasts a population well over the edge of the chart below, dwarfing dozens of other Wisconsin counties by nearly a million. As a "metropolitan center," like Gehl put it, and based on all the other evidence, the state's biggest county should be above the average for state vaccination totals. Indeed, it falls about 3% short of that total, as 2/3 or roughly 67% of the state's population is fully vaccinated.

			<h3>4. Social Media and Conspiracism Create Misinformation</h3>
			<p> In American vaccination culture the past four years, there has undeniably been conspiracism through social media. Many content creators have framed their arguments as factual when in reality they are promoting themselves and gain an anti-vaccination following. But, not all conspiracies come intentionally. This is about gaps in education. </p>
			
			<p> "The typical turnaround for vaccinations is mutliple decades... but the vaccine in this case was produced in less than a year," Jagiello said. </p> 
			The quick response time for a lab to public distribution was "excellent," Gehl said. However, that contributed to misinformation because mRNA was a new technology rather than the typical DNA vaccination patients were used to. Gehl believes the disparity has tended to be more noticeable among an older, more conservative generation, but the one fact she points out about the Covid-19 pandemic is the internet has been centripetal, especially for those who don't know how to navigate it. 

			<p> "Socials were intended to be the gadget that allowed people to connect... from an ideological standpoint, when it truly feels like the opposite at times," Gehl said. But because people with different backgrounds and different education levels have different "perceptions of reality," individuals with different basic characteristics often are too stubborn to educate themselves on the contrary thought process. </p>
			<p> 
			According to <a href="https://digitalcontextnext.org/blog/2023/11/14/people-get-their-information-from-social-media-but-dont-trust-it/" target="_blank">Digital Context Next.org,</a>  78% of people report often reading info deliberately falsified by the source on social media, an obvious unfortunate caveat that comes with unfiltered posting. But, when he used to interact with individual patients in his previous role, Jagiello used that to create a foundation of correct thought processes for his patients.
			</p>
			<p> "Non-judgmental [education] is so valuable because some people will respond very well to a trusted source," Jagiello said. "Doctors used to top the list of what profession people trusted the most," he said, emphasizing healthcare providers ought not take their patients' faith in medical advice for granted. The same goes for patients, who have steadily lost faith in their providers across the country since the pandemic.</p>

			<h4 align="center"> <b> Though the National State of Emergency from the pandemic was lifted in May of 2023, there are still a couple clear takeaways for medicine and vaccinations: </b> </h4>
			<p> 
			</p> <ul>
				<section> <h3> <p> <li>There has been a "huge paradigm shift" towards telehealth by health care providers, as federal agencies like the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services now cover almost half of the American population virtually. "This allows rural doctorship directly between a provider and a patient, which helps maintain the patient's trust," Jagiello said. Telehealth "will persist long after the pandemic, but it was started by the coronavirus." </li> </p>
				
				<p> <li>Genetic mutation is often the catalyst for new viruses to spread, as mutations are able to counteract immunizations and cause illness in humans. "In America, things will be different for the next pandemic," Jagiello said. "I am confident the government will be better prepared and will stumble less when forming consistent recommendations to the public in the next [pandemic]. Because there <i> will </i> be a next time." </li> </h3> </p>
